the first cut should probably be written in python using gtk

the difficult but useful part will be maintaining the location of the scroll bar
it should track code movement. I'm not sure the best way to do this though.

load all the revisions of a file from git-rev-list

line movement should be weighted against perhaps proportionally to the distace from the edge of the window
alternatively the middle line can be highlighted and stay centered. (this might be more intuitive)

we need a mapping from the current lines to the new lines.

it would be good if the movement was bijective and use f(x) for motion in one direction and f^-1(x) for
movement in the other. Or have f(x) == f^-1(x)
